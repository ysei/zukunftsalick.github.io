Fact: programmers are one of the laziest creatures on earth and when it comes to ruby programmers, like me, the problem is even worse. We donÂ´t like to spend more than 5 minutes cooking something while we could be doing something more important like chatting with your friends on freenode.

After spending more time than I wanted in the kitchen, I came with this recipe that is easily modifiable and IMHO itÂ´s delicious and nutritive. So, hereÂ´s what you need:
<ul>
	<li>olives, IÂ´m using french style olives, but you can use any other one</li>
	<li>balsamic vinegar, preferably an original one from Modena, Italy</li>
	<li>a good quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>honey</li>
	<li>cheese, you can choose, but I strongly recommend using goat cheese, camembert or brie</li>
	<li>cherry tomatoes</li>
	<li>vegetables, IÂ´m using lettuce and its variants, but Â you can put any other vegetable you like</li>
</ul>
First, start slicing the vegetables in way you can eat without cutting them.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-150" title="p1030249" src="http://www.pedropimentel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/p1030249-450x337.jpg" alt="p1030249" width="450" height="337" />

Then pour honey over the vegetables like drawing lines. Be careful not to add too much honey otherwise will be more a dessert rather than a salad.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-151" title="p1030251" src="http://www.pedropimentel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/p1030251-450x337.jpg" alt="p1030251" width="450" height="337" />

Cut the cheese in cubes and add it over the salad. As IÂ´m using goat cheese which is a little bit too strong for my taste, I added less cheese and due to its form factor, IÂ´m using slices of it

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-152" title="p1030252" src="http://www.pedropimentel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/p1030252-450x337.jpg" alt="p1030252" width="450" height="337" />

Now you add about 1.5 level tablespoons (15ml) of balsamic vinegar over the salad.

The lasts steps are no mistery: you add olives, cherry tomatoes, dress the salad with the extra virgin olive oil and thatÂ´s pretty much of it.

Now the best part: you can try your very new salad ! <strong><em>B</em></strong><em><strong>on AppÃ©tit</strong></em>

Just in case youÂ´re wondering about which olive oil and balsamic vinegar I used, here are them:
