<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.pedropimentel.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/barajas.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-95 alignnone" title="barajas" src="http://www.pedropimentel.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/barajas-300x450.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></a></p> <p style="text-align: left;">For those you don`t know, when I attended RailsConf Europe, I came to Europe to make a live test in a job I was applying. As you know by my blog post, RailsConf Europe was great. I just wrote one post about it, but that week was incredible busy for me. I still have my notes from the second day of RailsConf, but I don`t know if I`d post them.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">The fact is: I got approved (yaaayyy ). So I back to Brazil to  start arranging documentation to apply for a work permit in Spain (Madrid City). Now I`m in Madrid, working in the company. This changes a lot of things in my life, but it`ll be an amazing experience for me in any field.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Here i`ll learn a new language (spanish), work and learn with amazing people like Pratik Naik, Xavier Noria e Raul Benito, play guitar hero in the company when stressed, attend nice conferences in Europe like Goruco, RubyConf and others, meet new people in the effervescent nightlife of Madrid...</p> <p style="text-align: left;">One last thing: My google summer of project went live yesterday (October, 21) and everything is working fine. In case you want to check it out the URL is <a title="Christmas Future" href="http://www.christmasfuture.org/" target="_blank">http://www.christmasfuture.org/</a>.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Thanks,</p> <p style="text-align: left;">ps: In the picture is the amazing new terminal of Madrid`s airport</p>
