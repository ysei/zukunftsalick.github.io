The Book Rails 2.1 - What`s new ? Made by Carlos Brando and TapajÃ³s was released last week. It was the very first book presenting Rails 2.1 and its new features, in Portuguese, and best of all, it was released free of charge ( like free beer).

But Carlos Brando and the Brazilian rails community were very upset because most Railers of the world couldn`t read portuguese so they couldn`t rejoice the book like us. So I and other fellows, lead by Carlos Brando got together to translate the book to english, so all people could read and use it.

I`m very proud of being part of this community that made the translation and reviewed it in less than 2 days. You can <a href="http://www.nomedojogo.com/livro/carlosbrando-rubyonrails21_en.pdf">download the book here</a> or from Carlos Brando blog.
